Apache Flex 4.12 is an update to Apache Flex 4.11. [attachment_7529] Known Issues _____________ Adobe Flash Builder Integration Adobe Flash Builder 4.7 and Adobe Flash Builder 4.6 both contain a bug where, when generating the .mxml file for a new project that uses Apache Flex 4.10.0 and Spark Application, Flash Builder will incorrectly insert the attribute: layout="absolute" This results in a compile error in the new project. The remedy is to simply remove the errant attribute. The following wiki page has been set up to contain the latest news on Adobe's attempt to correct this problem: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Adobe+Flash+Builder+'New+Project'+Bug Adobe have provided a patch for Flash Builder 4.7 that resolves this issue: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-builder/kb/flex-new-project-issue--.html Differences from Apache Flex 4.11 include: SDK Changes ------------- - Improved Callout for Desktop. - Improved UID generation performance. - Changed DPI to be 160 for iPad and 320 for iPad mini. - Improvements to Falcon MXML code generation.
