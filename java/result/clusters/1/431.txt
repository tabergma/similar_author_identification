This was a rather flippant cartoon I drew yesterday in my notebook, that actually makes a serious point about our business model, namely: 1. Now that the ideas of “job for life” and “work-life balance” are well and truly consigned to the dustbin of history… 2. Now that we’re expected to answer work emails at 11pm on Christmas Eve… 3. Now that we’re expected to fly to Chicago in February, so we can get up at 6a.m. in time for a breakfast meeting and talk about nothing for five hours [This actually happened recently to a Geneva-based friend of mine]… 4. Now that instead of getting business cards printed up like a normal person, we devour our so-called free time writing business books and trying to figure out how to get them published… 5. Now that anything that is any good is overpriced and bleeding us white… 6. Now that we consider ourselves successful, yet still spend four hours a day stuck in traffic… 7. Now that the average adult’s life is governed by a level of FOMO that was traditionally reserved for insecure teenagers… 8. Now that the rich are working longer hours than the poor for the first time in history… 9. Now that a nice, middle class neighborhood in the big city is quickly becoming a thing of the past . 10. Now that the party is FRICKIN’ OVER… i.e. The nature of work is changing. People’s relationship with work is changing. The changes to society will be vast. And the companies that understand this better than the other guy will be the companies that win. Which is why “Culture” is not just another business fad , but actually something REALLY important. Consider yourself told.
