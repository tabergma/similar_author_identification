“Dialog about Germany” – this is how the german chancellor called an internet platform to enable german citizens to participate to politics ( www.dialog-ueber-deutschland.de ). The principle: Suggestions about a better life with other people in this country are formulated and published on that site, in a second step other site visitors are invited to vote about them. “A good opportunity to pinpoint the bad situation of families in Germany”, I told myself and then I added my own first suggestion ( Kinder und Eltern besser stellen ). Since there are no limitations about the topic or the number of suggestions one could publish on this website I added another one about the denial of kosher butchering in Germany ( Verbot des Schächtens ). In the meantime the campaign has come to an end and the final votes are published: 64 persons voted for the enhancement of the situation of families and their children in Germany, whereas 302 persons voted for the denial of kosher butchering in Germany. In other words: Five times as many people in Germany feel closer to the well-being of cows than to children and their parents. So far so good about the myth about family- and child-friendly politics in Germany. There is no doubt, which conclusions especialy wooed specialists should draw from this facts, since they are not only supposed to move to Germany for working.
