Make sure to review this document to see what has been changed. Known Issues _____________ Adobe Flash Builder Integration Adobe Flash Builder 4.7 and Adobe Flash Builder 4.6 both contain a bug where, when generating the .mxml file for a new project that uses Apache Flex 4.10.0 and Spark Application, Flash Builder will incorrectly insert the attribute: layout="absolute" This results in a compile error in the new project. The remedy is to simply remove the errant attribute.
