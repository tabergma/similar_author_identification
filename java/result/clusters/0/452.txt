Turbo is a Chihuahua puppy who was born without front legs . His owners brought him to a veterinary office in Indianapolis, Indiana when he was a month old. They had tried to care for him, but it was proving impossible for Turbo to feed with his littermates. The owners didn't want euthanize him, so they handed him over to the clinic. The staff at The Downtown Veterinarian has been caring for him ever since. Since a dog can't be fitted for a wheeled cart until he's at least 6 months old, the staff has been improvising. They've taken toys apart and used them to make substitute legs . His first set was originally from a Fisher Price helicopter. The staff is making new carts for Turbo as he grows. -via Huffington Post (Photos: Turbo/Roo )
