Thirty fights and now 27 KOs, the Kazakhstan fighter once again showed just how powerful he is as he nailed Daniel Geale in New York on Saturday night. While the list of people we wouldn’t like to get in the ring with is very, very long, we think we would have to put Gennady Golvkin near the top. The Kazakh middleweight is simply a KO machine, with only three of his 30 fights going to the judges. Needless to say, at 32, he remains unbeaten and he’s the reigning IBO and WBA champion. The latest man to try and end his run was Australian Daniel Geale, who had a not too shabby 30-3 record of his own. Geale was downed in the second round before GGG ended the fight for good in the next. Geale landed a pretty decent punch of his own but a cracking right hand by the champion put Geale down again and he was unable to continue.   There’s talk that next for GGG could be Miguel Cotto, which would be a mouthwatering prospect.
