I seared hot peppers from my garden in a butter and fresh sage until blackened along the edges in a skillet. I placed pork chops, seasoned in salt and pepper on top of pepper, sage and butter mixture to brown. When the pork chops are seared brown along the edges on both sides, I seared two slices of pineapple for a couple minutes in the same skillet. This helps infuse the flavors together, but I remove the pineapples after they’ve browned along the edges. I poured about half a cup of water into the skillet with the pork chops to steam them through. While this is cooking, I’ve boiled some broccoli until they are vibrant green. I’ve used the same sage flavors in the pork chop in roasting baby potatoes.  Chopped red and white potatoes mixed in olive oil, sage, salt and pepper until softened. Depends on how large your potato pieces are, but I cooked mine at 425 for 15 minutes. I’ve plated the pork chops on top of the seared pineapples to cut the spicy, peppery flavor of the pork chops with the sweetness of the fruit. I love being able to cook with vegetables and herbs I’ve grown myself! The sage and peppers came from my own garden and helped inspire the rest of the meal.   The post Herbed Butter Pork Chops on top of Sauteed Pineapples appeared first on Kate Style Petite .
