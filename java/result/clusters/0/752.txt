We all know that bra fitting can be a nightmare, especially when one shop tells you you’re a B, while another is telling you you’re a DD. How does that even work?! A new study by the University of Wollongong is planning to change all that, by using three-dimensional imaging to measure breast size and shape, collecting data that could alter the way that bras are designed in future. PhD candidate Celeste Coltman is leading the study, having struggled herself to find well-fitting and supportive bras. She told the Sydney Morning Herald : ”What a lot of bra companies have been doing is trying to use whole body scanners to get chest circumference measurements, which they then use for bra fit. But in women with large breasts, their breasts tend to rest on the torso, so you can’t see that.” She says this means manufacturers often overestimate the measurements, so the hand-held scanner she is using is much more beneficial.The scanner, which is about the size of a large camera, creates a three-dimensional image on a computer in real time. Coltman added: ’’A hand-held scanner has the benefit of allowing the body position to be changed to get more accurate measurements there. It allows for a greater range of motion, as opposed to the whole body scanner. Which I think has really great translational benefits for pattern-making and bra design.” Coltman is not only collecting data, but she’s also measuring participants of the study, and teaching them how to correctly measure their own breast size, having noticed that so many of her participants are wearing the wrong bra size. The study still needs another 400 participants, so if you’re interested in finding out your actual bra size, and helping save the bra measuring business, then just hop on a flight to Australia and join the study.
