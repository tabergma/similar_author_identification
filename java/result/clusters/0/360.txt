To the Public (1931) by Kurt Tucholsky Dear, dear public, tell me: Are you really as dumb, as we hear every day from all the businessmen? Directors on their fat behinds say: "It's what the public wants!" The men in film: "What can I do? The public wants these saccharine things!" Publishers shrug their shoulders and say: "Good books don't sell!" Tell me, dear public: Are you really that dumb? So dumb, the newspapers, morning and late, hold less and less to read? Anxious someone might be offended; In fear, no one must be incited; Apprehensive that MÃ¼ller and Cohn might threaten with cancellation? Nervous that finally some organization will come and protest and denounce and demonstrate and litigate... Tell me, dear public: Are you really that dumb? Well then... On our time weighs the curse of mediocrity. Have you such a weak stomache? Truth disagrees with you? You'll only eat mush? Well, then... Well, you deserve what you get. David's rendering will follow in a few days. The German original may be read here . Postscript: I located a quote by Tucholsky online which apparently originates from the first lines of the third stanza, translated somewhat differently: "The burden of our times is the curse of mediocrity." My translation is more literal, in that the original uses a verb (lastet), which was converted here to a noun. Possibly though, burden is a stronger word than weigh. Interesting to see how other people tackle the same text.
