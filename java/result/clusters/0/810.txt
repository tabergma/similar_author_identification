I have wanted a Bluetooth tracker since forever. The idea of a little device that alerts me of something missing just sounds perfect. Does anyone else feel the same way? For one reason or another though I can't find one that just works. I have received three now via kickstarter, all three have bugs or are being sent back for replacement. I have another three waiting in the winds. Why is it so hard to make this device. Will it take a big company like Google or apple to really crack it. I think Google would sell millions if they made one, but maybe I am on my own? Sent from my Nexus 5 using Tapatalk
