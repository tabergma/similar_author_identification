Add these gems to your playlist… Everyone in JOE Towers love their music and we especially love new music. Every week we trawl the internet to find the best new releases from all over the globe and because we’re sound lads, we want to share what we find with you. This week’s line-up is pretty special with the beautiful acoustic sounds of Raury , Austrian electro-house group Klangarussell with a monster tune and Sinkane ‘s lovely low key ‘How We Be’. Also in there this week is the amazing, Florence-esque Little Deeds , Dublin’s Girl Band with their new belter and London four-piece ESCAPISTS that fans of Foals will enjoy. Get stuck in.
