The Free Economy (1930) By Kurt Tucholsky Abolish those cursed tariffs Trust your company director. Walk out of the arbitration committees. Leave everything else to your boss. No more union talking their way in, we want to be free economists! "Away with groups" - on our banner! Now, not you. But us. You don't need rest homes for your lungs, no retirement and no insurances. You should all be ashamed of yourselves, taking money from the penniless State! You should no longer stand together. Would you please disperse yourselves! No cartels in our territory! Not you. But us. We're building into the farthest future trusts, cartels, associations, concerns. We stand next to the furnace flames in syndicated groups. We dictate the prices and the contracts - no law will get in our way. We stand here well organized... Not you. But us. What you're doing is Marxism. Down with it! We're assuming the power, step by step. No one's disturbing us. Complacently the ruling socialists stand by and watch. We want you individually. To arms! That's the newest economic theory! The demand has not been made that a German professor couldn't justify. Working for our ideas in the factories are officers of the old army, the Steel Helmets, the Hitler garde ... You, in cellars and attics, Don't you see what they're doing with you? With whose sweat the profit is gained? No matter what might come. The day will arrive, when the crusading worker calls: "Not you. But us. Us. Us." ------- This originally appeared in "Die Weltbuehne" March 4th, 1930, page 351. The German original may be read at the Kurt Tucholsky Webblog . Interestingly, this poem - as reported by the linked source - has surfaced quite often on German Websites, Weblogs, and in the press, but with omission of the fourth stanza.
