Summer is upon us, and several volunteers (and many funders!) have helped us put together a table here in Virginia Beach to speak up for the hermies at the Old Beach Green Market. We’ve already spent two Saturdays out at the festival, giving away hundreds of leaflets, teaching kids about hermit crabs with awesome games, and shedding light on why buying a hermit crab is harmful to these ocean critters. Check out some of the pictures below! We’ve also just launched our brand new care sheet, with tons of tips on how to help your hermie live for up to 30 years! Check it out below, and visit our Get Active page to learn how you can spread the word!
