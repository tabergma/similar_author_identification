MaSoNiC CaTHoLiC PRieST aT PiaZZa DeL GeSu GRaND LoDGe oF iTaLY iN RoMe No surprise either, as both the Scottish Rite Supreme Council 33° of the Gran Loggia d’Italia (GLDI, founded in 1910 after a schism with the Grande Oriente d’Italia) & the Church of the Gesù – the mother church of the Jesuits – are located in Piazza del Gesù! In fact the GLDI is known as the Piazza del Gesù obedience. This body is recognised by the Scottish Rite’s US Southern Jurisdiction (“Mother of the World”) Supreme Council 33° in Washington, DC. The Jesuits control both the Roman Catholic Church & many elements within high-level Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic. The Grande Oriente Italiano obedience (founded 1975, not to be confused with the Grande Oriente d’Italia) is also to be found at Piazza del Gesù, as is the Scottish Rite Supreme Council 33° of the Gran Loggia Nazionale Italiana (founded 1979). - TS Sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Loggia_d%27Italia http://www.massoneriascozzese.it/altreobbedienze.htm http://www.paginecattoliche.it/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=193 http://www.prontoimprese.it/lazio/roma/roma/associazioni-artistiche-culturali-e-ricreative+39.html http://www.masonicworld.com/education/files/nov06/a_modern_pythagorean.htm http://www.mainemasonrytoday.com/history/Proceedings/proc1955p16.htm http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=49344 Catholic World News (CWN) Italian priest joins Masons Rome, Feb. 19, 2007 (CWNews.com) – An Italian Paulist priest has become a member of the Masons, joining the group in a ceremony attended by about 40 people at the Masonic headquarters at Piazza del Gesu in Rome. Father Rosario Francesco Esposito dismissed the Church ban on membership in the Masonic lodge, saying that it is “a thing of the past.” The move by the 85-year-old Father Esposito is particularly interesting because he, along with Father Giovanni Caprile, SJ [Note: SJ = Society of Jesus = Jesuits - TS] , was once commissioned by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to study the Church’s teaching on masonry. In 1983 the prefect of the Congregation, then-Cardinal [Note: & SMOM Knight of Malta - TS] Joseph Ratzinger [Note: now Pope Benedict XVI - TS] , made a public announcement that the teaching of the Church had not changed, and the ban on Masonic membership remained in place.
