It's day two of Comic Con International: San Diego, and to celebrate,   Julia Lepetit and Andrew Bridgman from Dorkly  bring you the fourth installment of “People You See At Every Nerd Convention.” The jacked dude only there to rock shirtless cosplay. The twenty slave Leia's and one ignored non-slave Leia. The smelly guy who has clearly been wearing the same costume every day of the con. As well as checking out the most newly recognized categories of con attendees, see them all in parts one, two and three. Via Geeks are Sexy.
