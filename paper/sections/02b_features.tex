\subsection{Features}
\label{sec:features}

An individual's writing style can be discerned by various attributes or features inherent to any written text.
Some of these features are topic-dependent, e.g. the count of occurrence for each existing word in the bag of words model.
A text containing an above average number of occurrences of words like ``DNA'', ``sequence'', ``genome'', and ``mutation'' will most likely be from the field of genome research.
Thus, this feature will be similar for most texts from this domain and therefore is topic-dependent.


However, since we want to classify blog posts independent of topic, we can only utilize topic-independent features.
We represent these features as real valued numbers, normalized to be between $0$ and $1$.
Each attribute of a text can be represented by multiple features, for example the frequency of punctuation characters can have one feature per punctuation character, denoting that character's frequency as a fraction of all characters.
After calculating all features, the combination of them is interpreted as a vector for each text and then passed on to the clustering or classification step.


We have selected a number of these topic-independent features from~\cite{madigan2005author} and~\cite{narayanan2012feasibility} and added a few of our own, which are more tailored towards blog posts, e.g. emoticons.
A list of the feature types we initially used as well as more detailed descriptions for some of them can be found in Section~\ref{sec:impl_features}.
