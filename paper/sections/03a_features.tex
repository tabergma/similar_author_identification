In Table~\ref{tab:featureTable} we describe all the features we used along with their respective individual feature count.


One of the features we utilized, the FunctionWord feature might appear to clash with our desire to create a topic-independent algorithm which does not use a Bag of Words model.
However, function words are words with little or no lexical meaning, mainly used to create the grammatical structure of a sentence.
Thus, they are actually topic-independent and the frequency of their usage has been successfully utilized to identify authors~\cite{mosteller1962applied}.
We also tried to achieve topic-independence for our list of common abbreviations which we used in the same way.
The full list of function words and abbreviations we used for German and English can be found in TODO:Appendix.


Our emoticon feature is one that we selected to specifically target the blogging realm.
Since emoticons hardly ever appear in traditional written works, they have not been utilized when trying to identify authors outside of the internet.
In the blogosphere, however, there are some users who utilize lots of emoticons and others that don't use them at all.
The types of emoticons used also differ from person to person which is why we decided to implement that feature as a binary value of a certain emoticon appearing in the text or not.
A listing of the emoticons our system uses can also be found in TODO:Appendix.

After evaluating our features (see Section~\ref{sec:evaluation_clustering}) we decided to drop the Prefix/Suffix feature and keep all others.
