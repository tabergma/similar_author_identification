\subsection{Features}
\label{sec:features}

An individual's writing style can be discerned by various attributes or features inherent to any written text.
Some of these features are topic-dependent, e.g. the count of occurrence for each existing word in the “Bag of Words” model [TODO: Reference?].
A text containing an above average number of occurrences of words like “DNA”, “sequence”, “genome”, and “mutation” will most likely be from the field of genome research.
Thus, this feature will be similar for most texts from this domain and therefore is topic-dependent.


However, since we want to classify blog posts independent of topic, we can only utilize topic-independent features.
We represent these features as real valued numbers, normalized to be between 0 and 1.
Each attribute of a text can be represented by multiple features, for example the frequency of punctuation characters can have one feature per punctuation character, denoting that character's frequency as a fraction of all characters.
After calculating all features, the combination of them is interpreted as a vector for each text and then passed on to the machine learning or classification step.


We have selected a number of these topic-independent features from [TODO: References] and added a few of our own, which are more tailored towards blog posts, e.g. emoticons.
A list of the feature types we initially used can be found in Table~\ref{tab:featureTable} along with their respective individual feature count.
After evaluating our features (see Section~\ref{sec:evaluation_clustering}) we left the Prefix/Suffix feature out and kept all other.
