\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our program’s results and its usability could be improved in various ways: Adding more languages to our program’s repertoire would greatly increase its scope.
This would merely require adjusting the calculation of some of the features by adding an appropriate Part-of-Speech tagger and a function word list as well as new tests on the performance and feasibility of each feature.
Utilizing a larger and more diverse data set with a proper gold standard could allow for improved evaluation of our program’s ability to find exact matches for unknown authors.
This would also allow for a more in-depth discussion of which additional features to use and how to weight them.
Additional work could also be put into our clustering step by adding an additional phase prior to the k-means algorithm to attempt to find the optimal number of clusters for it to use.
Alternatively, evaluating the feasibility of other clustering algorithms is also an option.
